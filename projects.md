## Academic Project Deliverables

### <ins> Capstone: Effect of Digoxin on Mortality and Hospitalization </ins> [[file]](https://thyangjes.github.io//files/.pdf)

Programming: SAS



### <ins> Predictors of Hemoglobin A1C  </ins> [[file]](https://thyangjes.github.io//files/BS805_Course%20Project_JYang.pdf)

Programming: SAS

The project utilized datasets from two published studies focusing on cardiovascular risk factors among African Americans in central Virginia to predict Hemoglobin A1C levels. Data manipulation (cleaning, merging, and variable re-categorization), statistical analyses (two-factor ANOVA, piecewise linear model, and multiple linear regression), and model selection were executed to evaluate the relationship between BMI and Hemoglobin A1C.

The findings of this project revealed that the natural log of HbA1c was a more suitable outcome for assessing the linear relationship with BMI, But the association was no longer observed after adjusting for various predictors including age, sex, total cholesterol, SBP, and waist, highlighting the importance of considering multiple factors in predicting HbA1c levels.



### <ins> State-Level Variation In Low-Value Care  </ins> [[file]](https://thyangjes.github.io//files/Dashboard_LowValueCare.pdf)

Programming: Microsoft Excel

The project utilized administrative claims data from Optum and focused on low-value cancer screenings in the US pre-defined by Do et al. (2022) to conduct data visualization via dashboards in Microsoft Excel. 

Key objectives for the dashboard included measuring healthcare inefficiency in terms of utilization and spending and identifying states requiring policy interventions concerning low-value care in cancer screenings.



### <ins> Multiple Imputation on Missing Values   </ins> [[file]](https://thyangjes.github.io//files/BS845%20Final%20Project_JYang_revised.pdf)

Programming: R

This project implemented multiple imputation on a dataset with missing values from the Framingham Heart Study, aiming to provide comprehensive and rigorous data analysis for predicting cardiovascular disease risk factors. Data simulation and statistical analyses were carried out to compare two imputation methods, predictive mean matching (PMM) and random forest (RF). 

Results of the project indicated that RF showed smaller normalized root mean squared error (NRMSE) and bias in estimating mean imputed values, while PMM demonstrated better accuracy in estimating associations. No statistical significance was found between the two methods, and challenges remained in logistic regression models due to the binary outcomes' lesser information for estimating regression parameters.
