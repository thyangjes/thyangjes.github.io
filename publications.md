**Objective:** Many pediatric dermatologic conditions are associated with significant psychological impact to patients and their families, particularly before a diagnosis is made and explained. We asked about the experiences parents/guardians of children with vascular anomalies had at the time of diagnosis. 
 <br />
**Methods:** We conducted a mixed qualitative and quantitative survey study using Likert scale questions and free text questions. The survey was sent to vascular anomalies patient advocacy groups worldwide as well as Boston Medical Center dermatology clinics. Open-ended responses focused on feelings at the discovery of the anomaly, at the time of diagnosis, and suggestions for improving future interactions. A total of 77 out of 80 responses were eligible for data analysis. Three responses revealed that the patients did not have vascular anomalies.
 <br />
**Results:** We asked parents/guardians to rate how important several aspects of the diagnosis and counseling experience were to them and whether they were satisfied with the actual experience. The greatest discrepancy was around receiving information about patient support groups. Counseling tips on coping with the diagnosis and information on therapy for the parents were also rated as highly important yet often not received. Parents/guardians of children with more benign conditions were more often satisfied with the length of conversations with providers, yet more likely to report concern at the time of diagnosis than parents of children with more complex conditions that may not have been fully comprehended through a visual exam of the skin. Parents of children with complex conditions such as fibro-adipose vascular anomaly (FAVA) reported wanting longer conversations with providers. When asked for suggestions on how healthcare providers could improve the family experience, respondents emphasized: 1) the need for raising awareness of rare conditions in the general medical community; 2) the importance of empathy and emotional support from providers; and 3) a need to feel heard and recognized for their concerns and knowledge regardless of the severity of the vascular anomaly. 
 <br />
**Conclusion:** Parents of children with complex vascular anomalies were more likely to want longer conversations and to think of developing a plan as most helpful compared to those of children with benign conditions. Providers counseling parents about vascular anomalies for the first time can optimize the parent experience by allocating more time for explanations and questions than for typical visits, providing diagrams or handouts, practicing shared decision-making for treatment plans, and routinely connecting families with patient advocacy groups.
